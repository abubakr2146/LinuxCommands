Linux commands that you need to know before starting out.

Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system that is widely used for various purposes, from web servers to embedded devices. It offers a wide range of commands that can help you perform various tasks and automate processes. However, with so many commands available, it can be difficult to know where to start. To help you get started, we've compiled a list of the top 15 Linux commands that every beginner should know. These commands are essential for managing files, navigating the file system, managing processes, and more. In this blog, we will provide a brief overview of each of these commands, as well as examples of how they can be used. So whether you're a new Linux user or just looking to expand your knowledge, this list is a great place to start!


1.sudo

Super user do or otherwise more commonly known as the sudo command is one of the most essential Linux commands that you need to know.It enables you to run a command with the security privileges of the root user or any other user present in the system.

2.ifconfig

Ifconfig allows you to view information about your network interfaces.You can also use ifconfig to configure network interfaces, such as setting an IP address or enabling or disabling a network interface.It is an extremely important command to know if you are dealing with anything IT related.


3.alias

The ailas command allows you to put multiple commands in a single variable so that instead of writing the same command multiple times you could just use the alias variable to execute all of them.

4.pwd

The pwd command allows you to find out the current working directory that you are present in.It is useful for switching between directories and also to find out the path to a file if you need it.


5.cp

The cp command is used in Linux to copy files and directories. It stands for "copy." While you may be used to the windows copy function when you get used to it cp is much more superior to the windows copy function.

6.rm

Going by the order the next should be some sort of a delete command right? That is where rm comes in.Rm allows you to remove a file or directory by giving its respective path.


7.mv 

Then is the mv command.Sometimes you just want to move a file from one place to another,for that we have mv.It is similar to the cut functionality in windows.You can move directories or individual files by providing the respective paths.



8.man

Linux is not an easy operating system from the get go.You do need some sort of support to get the hang of it as a new user.Using the man command in terminal will bring up all sorts of options and details about a specific Linux command.

9.chmod

This command is used when you want to change the permissions of a file.It has the syntax 
 a + rwx
The a is for the user group in this case “all” , the r w x stands for read,write and execute permissions for the file.You can change the file permissions for groups or individual users.


10.htop
This command allows you to view all of the processes that your resources are being used for.It is easy for debugging a resource heavy process and then moving on to eliminating it.


11.cat
 
The cat commands allows you to view content inside of a file without opening it.It gives you a sneak peak inside the top content of a file to give you an idea of what exists in it.You don't need a GUI to look inside the file anymore.

12.kill

What do you do when a process is using up valuable resources or it  just gets stuck?
You use the kill command.Using htop or ps you can view the Process ID and then provide that ID to the kill command to eliminate that process.

13.shred

Now this is a unique command,you have most probably heard about paper shredders.They are machines used to cut pages into small pieces so that any information cannot be recovered from them.If you want file recovery to be almost impossible then you can use this command.

14.tail
The cat command is the opposite of the tail command.While the cat commands shows the top content of a file , the tail command shows the last content of a file.

15.grep

grep is a command-line tool in Linux used for searching and filtering text. It stands for "global regular expression print." grep searches for lines in a file or input that match a specified pattern and returns the matching lines.
